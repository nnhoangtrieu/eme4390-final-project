        <h2>1. Deepfake Elon Musk Crypto Livestream (2024)</h2>
        <p>
          Scammers hijacked a verified YouTube channel and rebranded it as “Tesla,” then ran a livestream featuring a
          deepfaked Elon Musk promoting a fake cryptocurrency giveaway. The synthetic Musk told viewers to send Bitcoin or
          Ethereum to a wallet with the promise of doubling their money. In a couple of hours, viewers sent more than
          $50,000 before the stream was taken down.

        <h2>2. TikTok “DeepTomCruise” Celebrity Face-Swap (2021)</h2>
        <p>
          On TikTok, the account @DeepTomCruise posted ultra-realistic videos of what appeared to be Tom Cruise golfing,
          doing magic tricks, and joking with the camera. In reality, a visual effects artist and an actor used AI to map
          Cruise’s face onto another performer. Millions of viewers were fooled at first, and the videos were widely
          covered as an example of how convincing deepfake entertainment has become.

        <h2>3. Arizona AI "Kidnapping" Scam Call (2023)</h2>
        <p>
          An Arizona mother received a call from a voice that sounded exactly like her teenage daughter sobbing and
          begging for help, claiming she had been kidnapped. A man then demanded ransom, threatening violence if she
          involved the police. The voice turned out to be an AI clone built from online audio clips. The event was so
          realistic that she later testified about it before the U.S. Senate, warning that these scams weaponize a
          parent's worst fears.

        <h2>4. Dover, Florida Mother Voice-Cloning Scam (2025)</h2>
        <p>
          In Dover, Florida, a mother was tricked into paying $15,000 after receiving a call from what she believed was
          her daughter. The caller claimed the daughter had caused a car accident and was in jail needing bail. The voice
          was cloned so well that the mother later said there was nothing that could have convinced her it wasn’t her real
          child. Detectives suspect AI voice technology was used.

        <h2>5. Zelenskyy Deepfake Surrender Video (2022)</h2>
        <p>
          During Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a deepfake video surfaced showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy
          apparently telling troops to lay down their arms and surrender. The video aired briefly on a hacked Ukrainian TV
          channel and spread online before being debunked. Viewers later noticed odd details like unnatural head movement
          and mismatched lighting, and Zelenskyy quickly released a real video denouncing the fake.
