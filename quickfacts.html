        <h2>Warning Signs of AI Identity Misuse</h2>
        <p>These are practical red flags that ordinary people can watch for.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="warning-grid">
        <div class="warning-card" data-tooltip="Scammers rely on panic so you react before thinking or verifying.">
          <h3>1. Extreme Urgency</h3>
          <p>
            The caller or message demands that you act immediately, send money, share codes, or transfer funds, and warns
            that something terrible will happen if you delay.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="warning-card" data-tooltip="Criminals often push you away from secure, traceable systems.">
          <h3>2. Strange Payment Methods</h3>
          <p>
            You are asked to pay in gift cards, cryptocurrency, wire transfer, or cash courier instead of normal, traceable
            methods.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="warning-card" data-tooltip="Deepfakes sometimes have subtle artifacts if you look closely.">
          <h3>3. Slightly “Off” Audio or Video</h3>
          <p>
            The voice sounds almost perfect but has odd pauses, robotic emphasis, or missing background noise; video may
            show weird lighting or lip-sync issues.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="warning-card" data-tooltip="Legitimate organizations encourage verification; scammers discourage it.">
          <h3>4. Secrecy &amp; Isolation</h3>
          <p>
            The person insists you tell no one and discourages you from hanging up or calling a trusted friend or relative
            to check the story.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="warning-card" data-tooltip="Real companies and banks have procedures and never rely on a single call for large transfers.">
          <h3>5. Bypassing Normal Procedures</h3>
          <p>
            Requests come through unusual channels (personal WhatsApp, random email) instead of official company systems or
            known phone numbers.
